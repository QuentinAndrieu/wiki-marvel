  <h3>Marvel Comics</h3>
  <p>Marvel Comics is the common name and primary imprint of Marvel Worldwide Inc., formerly Marvel Publishing, Inc. and Marvel
    Comics Group, an American publisher of comic books and related media. In 2009, The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel
    Entertainment, Marvel Worldwide's parent company.</p>
  <p> Marvel started in 1939 as Timely Publications, and by the early 1950s, had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The
    Marvel branding began 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created
    by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others.</p>
  <p> Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Doctor Strange,
    Iron Man, Deadpool, Wolverine, Daredevil, Ms. Marvel, and Ant-Man, such teams as the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy,
    the Inhumans, S.H.I.E.L.D., the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men, and antagonists such as Doctor Doom, Red Skull, Green
    Goblin, Thanos, Ultron, Doctor Octopus, Magneto, Venom, and Loki. Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a
    single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with locations that mirror real-life cities. Characters such as Spider-Man,
    the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, Daredevil, and Doctor Strange are based in New York City, whereas the X-Men have historically
    been based in Salem Center, New York and Hulk's stories often have been set in the Southwestern United States.</p>
